## What's in a name?
Quite a bit, apparently. ***Transcendence*** has a meaning and itself is a backronym:    
***Transcendence:*** The state of assembly code which **transcends** architectures.

## A PL/M & Intel 8080 Assembly to Arm M0+ Translation Tool.
- *__I dream of a translation tool for Assembly/Higher Level Languages to an ARM ISA:__*  
   - *__8-Bit: 8008, 8080, 8085, 6502, Z80, M6800__*  
   - *__16-Bit: 8086, Z800, Z8000, i186, i286__*  
   - *__32-Bit: Z80000, M68000, i386, i486__*
   - *__Languages: PL/M, Forth, Pascal__*

<sup>*__This is the starting point of that dream and tool.  
This is an extremely complex dream and will probably never be fully actualized.  
However I'm willing to try.__*</sup>

# NOTE - AUG 8th/9th 2024:
With the release of the Pico2 / RP2350, I will be switching over to utilize the M33 in the Pico2 rather than the M0+ in the Pico. 

This change will happen because the instruction set has changed from Thumb-1 on the Pico/M0+ to Thumb-2 on the Pico2/M33. 

This is a massive change if you worked with Thumb1/Thumb2. Thumb-1 has a limited set of instructions, while Thumb-2 extends this with more complex instructions similar to the full ARM instruction set.

Thumb-2 will allow for much faster and overall better conversion of instruction set to instruction set. In fact many of the pitfalls and problems I've encountered with Thumb-1 can be rectified with the usage of Thumb-2.

I was considering giving up on the Pico entirely because of Thumb-1. It's not really suited for this kind of project where as Thumb-2 more suits the level of complexity required.

For what it's worth, I will probably leave this repo as-is, archive it, and create a fresh repo when I receive my Pico2.

## Overview
Transcendence is a translation tool designed to convert Intel 8080 assembly language code into Arm M0+ assembly language, targeting platforms like the Raspberry Pi RP2040. The tool also aims to transpile PL/M language code into Arm M0+ assembly language, facilitating compatibility with older systems requiring CP/M operating systems or similar environments. Transcendence (for now) aims to bridge the gap between legacy various 8-Bit CPUs and PL/M codebases with modern Arm Cortex-M0+ platforms like the Raspberry Pi RP2040. By providing a reliable and efficient translation mechanism, it enables the preservation and utilization of vintage software while leveraging the capabilities of contemporary hardware.  

## Specification
Current specification is located here -> [Handling Differences a Specification](/specification/Handling_Differences_Specification.md)
- Note: The specification and playground code are NOT 1 to 1.
   - The `/python/playground/` drives the development of a better specification.
   - The `/python/spec/` directory contains a "working" specification example.

- [handling_differences.py](/python/spec/handling_differences.py)
   - This is now the same as [Handling Differences Specification](/specification/Handling_Differences_Specification.md).
   - Going forward, I will make an effort to follow this. The current playground doesn't follow this.

## Playground
You will find Intel 8080 assembly and PL/M regex patterns with subsequent pattern matching in the playground folder.  
This is where I try out ideas/work on designing the specification and Transcendence.
#### Playground History
- CP/M 2.2 in PL/M is completely pattern matched and PL/M has a complete set of regexes.
   - Looking for more PL/M code to test.
- Intel 8080 assembly has a complete set of regexes.
   - Looking for more I8080 assembly to test.
- I've added the files that guided me to create the [Handling Differences Specification](/specification/Handling_Differences_Specification.md).
   - [I8080_M0Plus_Mappings.py](/python/playground/maps/I8080_M0Plus_Mappings.py)
   - [Translate_I8080_to_M0Plus.py](/python/playground/Translate_I8080_to_M0Plus.py)
      - üê≤üêâ These are not great or even good. These are what drove me to create a specification. üêâüê≤
- Added SLY lexer and parser for I8080
   - [SLY_I8080.py](/python/playground/SLY_I8080.py)
      - Technically supports 8080 and 8085. 8085 is untested.
         - 8086 is also possible with a few additions and changes.
      - Allows for highly simplistic Abstract Syntax Tree construction.
      - üçñüç¥ Massive SLY refactor. Dragons cooked. üç¥üçñ
         - :godmode: Slain the lexing and parsing dragons. :godmode:
         - :hurtrealbad: Added inital pass for macros and directives. :hurtrealbad:
         - Deprecated.
      - Rebuilt the SLY lexer and Parser in PLY
         - All future updates will happen in PLY, not SLY. 
      - 8080_fp16.ASM lexes and parses in it's entirety.
         - 8080_fp16.ASM is a 8080 assembly implmentation of floating point math by Vitaly Lunyov.
         - üéÜüéÜüéÜNow I can focus on translating the AST into ARMv6-M ISA. üéÜüéÜüéÜ
            - I might work on 8085/8086 for a bit before I move on to translation.
               - Nah, I will try and fully translate I8080 to ARM THUMB before this, as the changes shouldn't be that major for 8085/8086.
      - Updated PLY lexer and parser to a decent status.
         - [PLY_I8080_NonBacktracking.py](/python/playground/PLY_I8080_NonBacktracking.py)
      - Created a baseline translation layer.
         - [PostProcessing_AST_Traversal_Translator.py](/python/playground/PostProcessing_AST_Traversal_Translator.py)

- M0+ Floating Point Math - m0plus_fp16_fp32.asm
   - Never been assembled, pure theoretical garbage.
   - See fp1632.s in pico/pico-asm-main/source/floatingpoint for a "real" implementation.

- M0+ OS - arm_os.asm
   - Initial theory file. Never been assembled, pure theoretical garbage.

- PLY Backtracking & Non-Backtracking
   - Started to develop a backtracking parser for AST generation. Leaving in repo for historical sake.
   - Terrible very very terrible garbage.
   - Just use a post-processing pass after the non-backtracking parser.

- VSCode Pico ASM PRJ + fp1632.s
   - CMake C/ASM/Cxx VSCode example project from https://blog.smittytone.net aka Tony Smith.
   - Contains fp1632.s in pico/pico-asm-main/source/floatingpoint
   - fp1632.s Has been assembled with the arm-de1soc simulator on https://cpulator.01xz.net/
   - No it has not been tested or assembled with a real assembler.

## Features Desired
